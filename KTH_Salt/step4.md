# Commanding the Minions
Now that we have connected Master and Minion, it is time to use Salt as it was meant. We can manage and send commands using the many modules that Salt has.

### Testing
Salt has a [testing module](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.test.html) that contains many fun tests we can try.

For example, 

```
sudo salt alpha 
```
# modules
